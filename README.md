The LemonWay API (called Directkit) has two implementations: Directkit**Json2** and Directkit**Xml**. 

The best way to integrate our API is to use the [`curl_init`] function to send POST request to the Directkit**Json2** service ([See the example here](https://github.com/lemonwaysas/php-client-directkit-json2))

It is the simplest and the most network-efficient way. However if you don't like the json format, you can also send SOAP (XML) requests to Directkit**Xml**.

**[SoapClient]** is the casual method in PHP to consume not only the Directkit**Xml** but any third-party Web Services

These examples demonstrate how to use the [SoapClient], it is tested with PHP 5.4.31 and PHP 7.

# Required extensions

In order to use [`SoapClient`], you have to activate the following extensions in `php.ini`

  * `extension=php_soap.dll` (Windows) or `soap.so` (Linux)
  * `extension=php_openssl.dll` (Windows) or `openssl.so` (Linux)

# Sample codes

```php
$client = new SoapClient(DIRECTKIT_WS."?wsdl");

$response = $client->GetWalletTransHistory(array(
        "wlLogin" => LOGIN,
        "wlPass" => PASSWORD,
        "language" => "fr",
        "version" => VERSION,
        "walletIp" => getUserIP(),
        "walletUa" => UA,
        "wallet" => "8888"
    ));

//print the response
echo "<pre>".json_encode($response, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT)."</pre>";
```

# SoapClient WSDL cache

(Please refer to the [SoapClient manual](http://php.net/manual/en/class.soapclient.php) for more information)
  
The SoapClient relies upon the WebService description (WSDL) to validate every SOAP requests and parse the SOAP responses. Your PHP Server will download and cache the WSDL in the first call.

> You must to keep your WSDL cache in sync with the WebService.

If you got
```
Fatal error: Uncaught SoapFault exception...
```
In most case, it means that your cached WSDL is outdated, please refresh the cache using one of the following methods.

# Manipulate the SoapClient WSDL cache in `php.ini`

In `php.ini` you can configure the cache folder and the expire time (ttl) of the WSDL cache or disable it completly.
```
[soap]
soap.wsdl_cache_enabled=1
soap.wsdl_cache_dir="/tmp"
soap.wsdl_cache_ttl=86400
```

You must to restart PHP server (or Apache) each changes in `php.ini`.

But **You can also force refresh the cache by deleting every `wsdl-*` files in the folder `wsdl_cache_dir`**. No need to restart your PHP Server.

# Manipulate the SoapClient WSDL cache in code

Please refer to the [SoapClient configuration](http://php.net/manual/en/soap.configuration.php) for more information

* Disable cache usage:
```php
ini_set("soap.wsdl_cache_enabled", 0);
```

* Redefine the expire time to 10 seconds so the cache will refreshed sooner / more frequently:
```php
ini_set("soap.wsdl_cache_ttl", 10);
```
